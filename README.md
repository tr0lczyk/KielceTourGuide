Kielce TourGuide
===================================

Tour guide application that shows the best landmarks in the beautiful city of Kielce. you can find information on top ten attractions, restaurants, landmarks and hotels. It's a multiscreen app with an ArrayList, ArrayAdapter and custom object's class. Each list-item (every place) could be displayed on a separate card with the click listener that sends intent to navigation app to show place's location. App is build on the fragments which scrolling help to move around the app. TabLayout is also implemented for the user's better experience. I am constantly working on updating my projects so any feedback is welcome.
